* Clojure GEE Demo

This repository contains some simple examples of how to access the
Google Earth Engine API from Clojure. We accomplish this by loading
the Python API provided by Google (earthengine-api) into our Clojure
code via the excellent [[https://github.com/clj-python/libpython-clj][libpython-clj]] library.

** Installation Requirements

- [[https://jdk.java.net][Java Development Kit (version 11+)]]
- [[https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started][Clojure CLI tools]]
- [[https://www.python.org/][Python (version 3)]]
- [[https://pypi.org/project/earthengine-api/][Python earthengine-api library]]

** GEE Authentication

To use Google Earth Engine, you must grant it access to your Google
account via an OAuth2 workflow:

#+begin_src sh
earthengine authenticate
# Follow the browser link to give GEE access to your Google account.
# Then copy the provided ID into the following command.
earthengine authenticate --authorization-code=<ID_FROM_BROWSER>
#+end_src

Your authentication token will be stored in
=$HOME/.config/earthengine/credentials=. This is used automatically by
your Clojure code whenever you run ~(ee/Initialize)~.

** Download libpython-clj

This is easily accomplished by simply running the ~clojure~ command
once from this repository's toplevel directory.

#+begin_src sh
clojure
#+end_src

As with all Clojure libraries, it will be downloaded and saved under
your =$HOME/.m2/repository/= directory.

** Usage

To test out the example code in this repository, simply open any of
the files under =src/clojure_gee_demo/= in your Clojure development
environment of choice, load the file into your REPL, and have fun!

When the first ~require-python~ form is evaluated,
~libpython-clj.python/initialize!~ will be called automatically. This
should autodetect your installed version of Python and add its library
path to the Java classpath, so that Python modules can be loaded into
Clojure namespaces. This can emit quite a bit of noise into your REPL,
but fear not! These should be merely informational messages rather
than any program errors.

If you are using a non-standard Python installation, take a look at
the docs for ~libpython-clj.python/initialize!~. By calling this
function at the top of your namespace, you can specify the locations
of the various executables and directories associated with your
particular Python setup.
